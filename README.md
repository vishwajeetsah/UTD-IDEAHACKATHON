# 🏛️ Problem Statement Details

**Problem Statement ID:** `SIH25059`
**Title:** *Enhancing Student Awareness on the Difference Between Aadhaar-Linked and DBT-Enabled Aadhaar-Seeded Bank Accounts*

**Problem Creator’s Name:** Puspendra Singh Bhadauriya
**Organization:** Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment (MoSJE)
**Department:** Department of Social Justice & Empowerment (DoSJE)

---

## 📌 Background

The **SCD-V Division, DoSJE** implements centrally sponsored schemes:

* *Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme for SCs & Others*
* *Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme for SC Students*

👉 The entire scholarship amount (from both State and Central Governments) is paid **only through DBT-enabled Aadhaar-seeded bank accounts**.

However, a large number of students **do not understand the difference** between a simple *Aadhaar-linked account* and a *DBT-enabled Aadhaar-seeded account*.

* As a result, many students fail to complete DBT seeding.
* This leads to **delays in scholarship disbursements**, creating financial stress for vulnerable students.

---

## 📌 Problem Description

* Lack of awareness regarding **DBT-enabled Aadhaar seeding**.
* Large number of students still using **only Aadhaar-linked accounts**, which are insufficient for scholarship transfers.
* Delayed payments cause **hardship for SC students**, who rely on timely financial assistance for education.
* Despite Government of India’s digital inclusion efforts, **awareness programs remain limited** at grassroots levels.

---

## 📌 Expected Solution

Students must be made **aware of the distinction** between Aadhaar-linked and DBT-enabled Aadhaar-seeded accounts, and guided step-by-step on how to enable DBT.

Proposed awareness measures:

* Notices on **Gram Panchayat boards**.
* Inclusion in **School Committees**.
* **Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) meetings**.
* **Public awareness campaigns** (digital & offline).

The solution should **empower students and parents** with clarity on DBT processes, reducing delays in scholarship credits.

Do you also want me to **shorten this into a one-slide infographic format** for your PPT (with 3 blocks: Background → Problem → Solution), so it doesn’t look text-heavy?
